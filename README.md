# Pi-hole Alert Monitoring Bot for Telegram

This bot monitors blocked domain requests in Pi-hole logs and sends instant alerts 
to Telegram (with Topics support) when matched domains from your filter list are detected.

**Key features:**
- Tracks domains from `config/filter_domains.txt`
- Supports Telegram Topics (threaded conversations)
- Handles large blocklists effectively
- Built-in spam protection (1 alert/hour per domain)
- Docker-ready configuration

Created after discovering suspicious domains in my Pi-hole logs and needing instant 
alerts about their blocked access attempts. Now sharing with the community!

## Compatibility
‚úîÔ∏è Works perfectly with blocklists from [hagezi/dns-blocklists](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists)  
*(Use Wildcard/Regex domains format)*
